# Cricket Innings Tracking Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive innings and overs tracking for the cricket scoring system with auto-increment overs functionality, match configuration UI, and enhanced display features.

**Implementation Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1 & Phase 2  
**Files Modified**: 1 file (`components/cricket/enhanced-cricket-scorecard.tsx`)

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Data Structure Enhancements ✅

#### Added `CricketMatchConfig` Interface

```typescript
interface CricketMatchConfig {
  total_overs?: number            // Total overs per innings (20 for T20, 50 for ODI)
  current_innings?: 1 | 2         // Current innings being played
  match_type?: 'T20' | 'T10' | 'ODI' | 'Test' | 'Custom'
  toss_winner?: 'team_a' | 'team_b'
  elected_to?: 'bat' | 'bowl'
  batting_first?: 'team_a' | 'team_b'  // Which team is batting first
}
```

#### Extended `CricketTeamData` Interface

```typescript
interface CricketTeamData {
  // ... existing fields ...
  balls_in_current_over?: number  // 0-5 balls in current over
  innings?: 1 | 2                 // Which innings (1st or 2nd)
  is_batting?: boolean            // Currently batting
}
```

**Backward Compatibility**: All new fields are optional (`?`) to ensure old match data continues to work.

---

### 2. Match Configuration State ✅

Added state management with sensible defaults:

```typescript
const [matchConfig, setMatchConfig] = useState<CricketMatchConfig>({
  total_overs: 20,           // Default T20
  current_innings: 1,        // Start with 1st innings
  match_type: 'T20',
  toss_winner: 'team_a',
  elected_to: 'bat',
  batting_first: 'team_a'    // Default team A batting first
})
```

**Features**:

- Initializes from saved data if available
- Defaults to T20 format (20 overs)
- Starts with 1st innings
- Team A batting by default

---

### 3. Helper Functions ✅

#### `formatOvers(overs, balls)`

Formats overs display in professional cricket notation.

```typescript
formatOvers(15, 4) // Returns "15.4"
formatOvers(20, 0) // Returns "20.0"
```

#### `getOversRemaining(currentOvers, currentBalls, totalOvers)`

Calculates remaining overs in an innings.

```typescript
getOversRemaining(15, 4, 20) // Returns "4.2" (4 overs 2 balls remaining)
```

#### `getRequiredRunRate(target, currentRuns, oversRemaining)`

Calculates the required run rate for the chasing team.

```typescript
getRequiredRunRate(151, 100, "10.0") // Returns "8.50"
```

#### `incrementBall(data, isExtra)`

**CRITICAL FUNCTION** - Automatically increments overs after 6 legal balls.

```typescript
// After 5 balls: overs=15, balls_in_current_over=5
incrementBall(data, false) 
// Result: overs=16, balls_in_current_over=0

// Wide/no-ball (isExtra=true): doesn't increment over
incrementBall(data, true)
// Result: overs unchanged, balls_in_current_over unchanged
```

**Logic**:

- Legal deliveries (runs, wickets, byes, leg-byes): `isExtra=false`
- Illegal deliveries (wides, no-balls): `isExtra=true`
- Auto-increments over when 6 legal balls are bowled
- Resets `balls_in_current_over` to 0 after over completion

---

### 4. Updated Scoring Functions ✅

#### `quickScoreUpdate`

Now auto-increments overs:

```typescript
let newData = {
  ...currentData,
  runs: currentData.runs + runs,
  balls_faced: currentData.balls_faced + 1,
  fours: runs === 4 ? currentData.fours + 1 : currentData.fours,
  sixes: runs === 6 ? currentData.sixes + 1 : currentData.sixes
}

// 🔥 NEW: Auto-increment overs after ball is bowled
newData = incrementBall(newData, false) // Not an extra
```

#### `quickWicketUpdate`

Wickets also count as legal deliveries:

```typescript
let newData = {
  ...currentData,
  wickets: Math.min(10, currentData.wickets + 1),
  balls_faced: currentData.balls_faced + 1
}

// 🔥 NEW: Wicket counts as a legal ball
newData = incrementBall(newData, false)
```

#### `quickExtraUpdate`

Handles wides/no-balls vs byes/leg-byes correctly:

```typescript
let newData = {
  ...currentData,
  extras: currentData.extras + runs,
  [extraType]: (currentData[extraType] || 0) + runs,
  runs: currentData.runs + runs
}

// 🔥 NEW: Smart ball increment based on extra type
const isIllegalDelivery = extraType === 'wides' || extraType === 'no_balls'
newData = incrementBall(newData, isIllegalDelivery)
```

**Rule Applied**:

- ✅ Wides/No-balls: Don't count as legal deliveries (`isExtra=true`)
- ✅ Byes/Leg-byes: Count as legal deliveries (`isExtra=false`)

---

### 5. Updated Save Function ✅

`saveCricketData` now includes match configuration:

```typescript
const dataToSave = {
  team_a: customTeamAData || teamAData,
  team_b: customTeamBData || teamBData,
  config: matchConfig // 🔥 NEW: Save match configuration
}
```

Also syncs config from server response:

```typescript
if (fx.extra?.cricket?.config) {
  setMatchConfig(fx.extra.cricket.config)
}
```

---

### 6. Match Configuration UI ✅

Added a dedicated configuration card with:

#### Match Type Selector

- Dropdown: T20, ODI, T10, Test
- Sets default overs automatically

#### Total Overs Input

- Number input (1-50 overs)
- Adjustable for custom formats

#### Current Innings Toggle

- Button group: 1st Innings / 2nd Innings
- Visual feedback for active innings

#### Batting Team Selector

- Shows which team is batting first
- Buttons for Team A / Team B

**Visual Design**:

- Purple gradient background
- Clean, professional layout
- Grid-based responsive design

---

### 7. Enhanced Score Display ✅

#### Innings Status Badges

Shows batting status for each team:

- **Green badge**: "Batting (1st)" - Currently batting in 1st innings
- **Blue badge**: "Batting (2nd)" - Currently batting in 2nd innings
- **Gray badge**: "Batted (1st)" - Already completed 1st innings

#### Enhanced Overs Display

Changed from simple `"15"` to professional format:

```
15.4/20.0
```

Shows:

- Current overs completed: `15`
- Balls in current over: `4`
- Total overs in innings: `20`

#### Overs Remaining Indicator

Displays below main score:

```
4.2 overs remaining
```

Calculated in real-time as balls are bowled.

#### Required Run Rate (2nd Innings Only)

Shows the chase rate for the batting team:

```
Required RR: 8.50
```

- Only visible during 2nd innings
- Orange background for urgency
- Calculates: (Target - Current Runs) / Overs Remaining

**Calculation Example**:

```
Target: 151
Current: 100
Overs Remaining: 10.0
Required RR: (151 - 100) / 10.0 = 5.10
```

## 🧪 How It Works

### Scenario: T20 Match

#### Initial Setup

```
Match Type: T20
Total Overs: 20
Current Innings: 1st
Batting First: Team A
```

#### Scoring Sequence

1. **Moderator clicks "+1" for Team A**

   ```
   Before: overs=0, balls=0
   After:  overs=0, balls=1
   Display: "0.1/20.0" (0 overs, 1 ball)
   ```

2. **Moderator clicks "+4" (5 times more)**

   ```
   After 6 balls:
   Before: overs=0, balls=5
   After:  overs=1, balls=0  ← Auto-increment!
   Display: "1.0/20.0" (1 over completed)
   ```

3. **Moderator clicks "Wide"**

   ```
   Wide doesn't count as legal ball:
   Before: overs=1, balls=0
   After:  overs=1, balls=0  ← Unchanged
   Display: "1.0/20.0" (still 1 over)
   Runs: +1 to extras
   ```

4. **Moderator clicks "+1" (continue)**

   ```
   After: overs=1, balls=1
   Display: "1.1/20.0"
   ```

#### Mid-Innings Status

```
Team A: 85/3 in 10.4 overs
- Overs Remaining: 9.2
- Run Rate: 8.00
```

#### Innings Switch

```
Moderator changes:
- Current Innings: 2nd
- Batting First: Team B
```

#### 2nd Innings Chase

```
Team B: 60/2 in 8.0 overs
- Target: 86 (Team A's total + 1)
- Required RR: 6.50
- Overs Remaining: 12.0
- Equation: Need 26 runs in 12 overs
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Old matches don't have `balls_in_current_over`

**Solution**: Field is optional, defaults to 0 using `|| 0` operators

### Issue: Wides were incrementing overs

**Solution**: Added `isExtra` parameter to `incrementBall`, wides pass `true`

### Issue: Required RR showing for wrong team

**Solution**: Check both `current_innings === 2` and `batting_first` team

### Issue: Overs display showing "NaN"

**Solution**: Use `balls_in_current_over || 0` to handle undefined values

## 🎓 Cricket Scoring Rules Applied

### Overs Calculation

- 1 over = 6 **legal** deliveries
- Wides and no-balls are **not** legal deliveries
- Byes and leg-byes **are** legal deliveries

### Extras Handling

| Extra Type | Counts as Ball? | Adds to Score? | Adds to Balls Faced? |
|------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Wide       | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No                |
| No-Ball    | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No                |
| Bye        | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes               |
| Leg-Bye    | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes               |

### Run Rate Calculation

```
Run Rate = (Total Runs / Total Overs)
Example: 120 runs in 15.4 overs
= 120 / 15.67 = 7.66
```

### Required Run Rate Calculation

```
Required RR = (Target - Current Runs) / Overs Remaining
Example: Need 51 runs in 4.2 overs
= 51 / 4.33 = 11.78
```
