# Cricket Player Tracking - Integration Fix Summary

## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Moderator Page Missing Team IDs
**File**: `app/moderator/fixtures/[id]/page.tsx`

**Problem**: The `EnhancedCricketScorecard` component wasn't receiving `teamAId` and `teamBId` props, so the player selection tabs weren't showing.

**Fix Applied**:
```tsx
<EnhancedCricketScorecard
  fixtureId={fixture.id}
  teamAId={fixture.team_a_id}      // ✅ ADDED
  teamBId={fixture.team_b_id}      // ✅ ADDED
  sportName="Cricket"              // ✅ ADDED
  teamAName={fixture.team_a?.name || 'Team A'}
  teamBName={fixture.team_b?.name || 'Team B'}
  // ... other props
/>
```

**Result**: ✅ Moderator page now shows 3 tabs:
- "Team A Players" - Select playing XI
- "Team B Players" - Select playing XI  
- "Current Players" - Select striker/non-striker/bowler

---

### Issue 2: Match Display Page Using Wrong Field Names
**File**: `app/match/[id]/page.tsx`

**Problem**: The public match page was looking for old field names that don't exist:
- ❌ `fixture.extra.cricket.current_striker_id`
- ❌ `fixture.extra.cricket.current_non_striker_id`
- ❌ `fixture.extra.cricket.current_bowler_id`

But we're actually saving them as:
- ✅ `fixture.extra.cricket.current_players.striker_member_id`
- ✅ `fixture.extra.cricket.current_players.non_striker_member_id`
- ✅ `fixture.extra.cricket.current_players.bowler_member_id`

**Fix Applied**:
Updated all references to use `current_players` object:
```tsx
// OLD ❌
currentStrikerId={fixture.extra.cricket.current_striker_id}

// NEW ✅
currentStrikerId={fixture.extra.cricket.current_players?.striker_member_id}
```

**Result**: ✅ Match page now correctly displays:
- Batting scorecards with striker/non-striker highlighting
- Bowling figures with current bowler highlighting
- Current Players card with live stats
- Fall of wickets timeline
- Partnerships display
