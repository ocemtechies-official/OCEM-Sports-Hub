## Data Flow

### Match Setup (Moderator)

1. Moderator opens fixture page
2. System fetches team_members for both teams
3. Moderator selects playing XI for each team
4. Moderator sets batting order
5. Moderator selects opening batsmen (striker, non-striker)
6. Moderator selects opening bowler
7. Match starts

### During Match (Moderator)

1. Moderator clicks +1/+4/+6 button
2. System updates:
   - Team score
   - Striker's runs, balls, SR
   - Bowler's runs conceded, economy
   - Current partnership
3. Moderator clicks wicket button
4. Dismissal dialog opens
5. Moderator selects:
   - Dismissal type
   - Bowler (if applicable)
   - Fielder (if catch)
6. System records:
   - Batsman as out
   - Fall of wicket
   - Ends partnership
7. Moderator selects next batsman
8. Match continues

### Public Display

1. User opens match page
2. System fetches fixture with cricket data
3. If player tracking exists:
   - Show batting scorecard
   - Show bowling figures
   - Show current players
   - Show fall of wickets
   - Show partnerships
4. Live updates via polling/subscription

## Database Queries

### Fetch Team Members

```typescript
const { data: members } = await supabase
  .from("team_members")
  .select("*")
  .eq("team_id", teamId)
  .order("member_order", { ascending: true });
```

### Save Match Data

```typescript
await supabase
  .from("fixtures")
  .update({
    extra: {
      cricket: {
        config: matchConfig,
        team_a: teamAScore,
        team_b: teamBScore,
        team_a_batting: teamABatsmen,
        team_b_batting: teamBBatsmen,
        team_a_bowling: teamABowlers,
        team_b_bowling: teamBBowlers,
        current_batting_team: "team_a",
        current_striker_id: strikerId,
        current_non_striker_id: nonStrikerId,
        current_bowler_id: bowlerId,
        partnerships: partnerships,
        fall_of_wickets: fallOfWickets,
      },
    },
  })
  .eq("id", fixtureId);
```

## Testing Checklist

### Public Display

- [ ] Shows batting scorecard when data available
- [ ] Shows bowling figures when data available
- [ ] Highlights current players
- [ ] Shows fall of wickets
- [ ] Shows partnerships
- [ ] Works without player data (backward compatible)
- [ ] Responsive on mobile
- [ ] Live updates work

### Moderator UI - Selection

- [ ] Can fetch team members

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility

- Old matches without player data still display normally
- New matches have enhanced display
- Graceful degradation if data incomplete

### Data Migration

- No migration needed for old data
- New matches automatically use new structure
- Can manually add player data to old matches

## Next Steps

1. Create display components (batting scorecard, bowling figures, etc.)
2. Update match display page
3. Create moderator player selection components
4. Update moderator scoring logic
5. Create dismissal dialog
6. Test complete flow
7. Deploy and monitor

## Success Criteria

âœ… Public display shows comprehensive player stats
âœ… Moderator can select playing XI easily
âœ… Scoring tracks individual player performance
âœ… Wickets recorded with full details
âœ… Partnerships and fall of wickets displayed
âœ… System works for both old and new matches
âœ… Mobile responsive
