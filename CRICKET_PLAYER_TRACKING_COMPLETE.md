## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Player Tracking State (15 new state variables)
- teamAMembers: TeamMember[]           // Playing XI for team A
- teamBMembers: TeamMember[]           // Playing XI for team B
- currentPlayers: CricketCurrentPlayers // Striker, non-striker, bowler
- teamABatting: CricketBatsmanData[]   // Batsmen stats team A
- teamBBatting: CricketBatsmanData[]   // Batsmen stats team B
- teamABowling: CricketBowlerData[]    // Bowler stats team A
- teamBBowling: CricketBowlerData[]    // Bowler stats team B
- partnerships: CricketPartnership[]   // All partnerships
- fallOfWickets: CricketFallOfWicket[] // Wicket timeline
- dismissalTarget: DismissalTarget     // For dialog
- isDismissalDialogOpen: boolean       // Dialog state
```

### Smart Scoring Logic (quickScoreUpdate)
```typescript
1. Validate current players selected
2. Update team score (runs, balls, overs, run rate)
3. Update striker stats:
   - runs, balls_faced, fours, sixes, strike_rate
   - Create new batsman record if first ball
4. Update bowler stats:
   - overs, runs_conceded, economy_rate
   - Create new bowler record if first ball
5. Update current partnership:
   - runs, balls
   - Start new partnership if needed
6. Auto-swap batsmen if odd runs (1, 3, 5)
7. Persist all data to database
```

### Wicket Recording Logic (quickWicketUpdate + handleDismissal)
```typescript
1. Validate striker selected
2. Get striker stats (runs, balls)
3. Open dismissal dialog with context
4. User selects:
   - Dismissal type (12 options)
   - Bowler (if applicable)
   - Fielder (if applicable)
   - Additional notes
5. On submit:
   - Update team wickets count
   - Mark batsman as out with dismissal details
   - Update bowler wickets (if applicable)
   - Add to fall of wickets timeline
   - End current partnership
   - Clear striker (moderator must select next)
6. Persist and notify
```
