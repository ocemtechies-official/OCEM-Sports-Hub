## New Files Created

### 1. Migration Guide

**File**: [scripts/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md](file:///d:/Web%20Codes/Web%20Application/OCEM%20Sports%20Hub/scripts/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md)

Comprehensive guide for migrating existing databases to support the new functionality, including:

- Step-by-step migration instructions
- Explanation of what the migration does
- Backward compatibility information
- Troubleshooting guide
- Rollback instructions

### 2. Test Scripts

**Files**:

- [scripts/test-profile-fields.js](file:///d:/Web%20Codes/Web%20Application/OCEM%20Sports%20Hub/scripts/test-profile-fields.js)
- [scripts/test-profile-fields.ts](file:///d:/Web%20Codes/Web%20Application/OCEM%20Sports%20Hub/scripts/test-profile-fields.ts)

Test scripts to verify the new profile fields work correctly:

- Insert test profile with new fields
- Query and verify all new fields
- Update specific fields
- Clean up test data

## Backward Compatibility

This upgrade is fully backward compatible:

- All existing data is preserved
- Existing applications continue to work without changes
- New fields are optional and can be populated gradually
- The AuthProvider automatically fetches all profile fields

## Migration Steps

1. Run the [07-add-profile-fields.sql](file:///d:/Web%20Codes/Web%20Application/OCEM%20Sports%20Hub/scripts/07-add-profile-fields.sql) script in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. No code changes are required in existing applications
3. The enhanced profile and settings functionality will automatically work

## Testing

To verify the migration:

1. Run one of the test scripts:

   ```bash
   # JavaScript version
   node scripts/test-profile-fields.js
   
   # TypeScript version
   npx ts-node scripts/test-profile-fields.ts
   ```

2. Or manually test by:
   - Logging into the application
   - Navigating to the profile page
   - Updating profile information with new fields
   - Verifying the data is saved and retrieved correctly
