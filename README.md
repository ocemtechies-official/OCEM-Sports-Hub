## Getting Started

This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Do not use npm or yarn as they may cause dependency conflicts.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- pnpm (version 8 or higher)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter dependency conflicts:

1. Make sure you're using pnpm instead of npm
2. Delete any `package-lock.json` files if they exist
3. Clear pnpm cache if needed: `pnpm store prune`
