# CAPTCHA Removal Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove CAPTCHA functionality from the authentication system.

## Overview

All CAPTCHA-related code has been removed from the authentication forms to simplify the implementation. The CAPTCHA functionality can be re-added later using the implementation plan documented in [captcha-implementation.md](captcha-implementation.md).

   - Removed reCAPTCHA import

   - Removed reCAPTCHA component from JSX

2. **components/auth/signup-form.tsx**

## Files NOT Modified

1. **package.json** - Kept reCAPTCHA dependencies for future use:
   - `react-google-recaptcha`
   - `@types/react-google-recaptcha`

2. **AuthProvider** - No changes needed as it didn't contain CAPTCHA code

## Re-adding CAPTCHA

To re-add CAPTCHA functionality in the future:

1. Follow the implementation plan in [captcha-implementation.md](captcha-implementation.md)
2. Update environment variables with your reCAPTCHA site key
3. No need to reinstall dependencies as they're already present

## Benefits of Removal

1. Simplified authentication flow
2. Removed potential hydration issues
3. Faster page loads
4. Reduced complexity in form handling
5. Easier testing and debugging

## Security Considerations

While CAPTCHA provides bot protection, the authentication system still maintains security through:

- Rate limiting
- Strong password requirements
- Email verification
- Secure session management
